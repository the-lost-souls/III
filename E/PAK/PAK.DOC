The first section of a PAK-file is the header. It contains general info
about the PAK, including a pointer to the filemap. The filemap is
compressed block array of PAK_FILE_BlockInfo's, and can be read as a
standard array. After decompressed, this array is used to locate and
read each file from within the PAK.
