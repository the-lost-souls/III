 Different routines 
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

[MN_MainLoop]

    Takes the offset in SYS_OListOffs and runs all the objects in this list.
    It first checks for fakeobjects and eventually end of list. Then it runs the
    plugin for the object, and at last checks if SYS_QuitFlag is set.

    Special offset-values:
            FFFFFFFFh	= End of objectlist
            00000000h	= Ignore object, don't run!

    Source located in \GENERAL\MAIN.ASM

    -include \GENERAL\MAIN.INC
    -link with \GENERAL\MAIN.OBJ or \GENERAL\SYS.LIB.





[KEY_Pressed]

    This is an object. Just set it up whenever in your objectlist, and it
    will break the MainLoop if keypressed. The routine for the object is
    called KEY_Pressed_, and source is located in \GENERAL\MAIN.ASM

    -include \GENERAL\MAIN.INC
    -link with \GENERAL\MAIN.OBJ or \GENERAL\SYS.LIB.





[ZERO_Object]

    If you set up an object with type 0000, this routine will be run. The
    objectroutine does nothing, but you may set up the objectstructure
    at your own choise. May be used for setting up plugins that needs no
    object. Located in \GENERAL\MAIN.ASM.

    -include \GENERAL\MAIN.INC
    -link with \GENERAL\MAIN.OBJ or \GENERAL\SYS.LIB.





[GIF_Load]

    Decodes a GIF87/89-file and stores it in memory. Works only with 256-color
    pictures, but does not test for extension-blocks. However, it DOES work
    with interlaced pictures.

    In:
         edx = OFFSET FileName
         ecx = Filesize. If zero then read to end of file
         esi = Position in file to read from

    Out:
         edi = Offset decoded picture
         GIF_SWidth    DD                                ;Screen horisontal res
         GIF_SHeigth   DD                                ;Screen vertical res
         GIF_Width     DD                                ;Image width
         GIF_Heigth    DD                                ;Image heigth
         GIF_XPos      DD                                ;Image's horisontal pos
         GIF_YPos      DD                                ;Image's vertical pos
         GIF_Colors    DD                                ;Number of colors in GIF
         GIF_Palette   DB 768 DUP (?)                    ;Palette (RGB)

         cf and SYS_QuitMsg set if any error


    It now also works with interlaced rasterdata. Still no testing for
    extension blocks.

    IMPORTANT NOTES!
         * The decoder won't work if GIF contains extension blocks (GIF89a)
         * It DOES work with interlaced pictures
         * NOT working with anything else than 256 color GIFs.
         * No testing of codevalues. A corrupt GIF will phuck up everything.
         * MEM-service must be initialized
