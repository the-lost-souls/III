PTC problems


Under svgalib FAKEMODE1A, FAKEMODE1B and FAKEMODE1C do not restore correctly
after the user switches back to the display from another virtual console.
This is because svgalib doesnt properly support a 320x600 vga tweaked mode,
which this fakemode needs, so PTC tweaks the 320x600 mode itself from
320x200 mode13h. All other modes (including the other fakemodes) restore
correctly after because they perform the modeset 100% through svgalib. To fix
this problem support for 320x600 tweakmodes needs to be added to svgalib as
G320x600x256. PTC is already setup to use this mode if it is #defined inside
svgalib so somebody add it already :)

Some users have been report problems with the DirectX support on some cards. 
If you experience any problems with the DX support please email ptc@gaffer.org
and describe the symptoms (or take a look through idirectx.cpp and see if you
can find/fix it yourself).


please report any other problems experienced to ptc@gaffer.org
