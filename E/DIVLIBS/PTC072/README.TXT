1. Introduction

PTC is a portable truecolor graphics system for C++ programmers. With PTC
you can write your graphics routines once and port between dos, win32 and
linux without any code change.

Programs that display output with software rendering can benefit greatly
from PTC. Examples of these programs include games, demos, raytracers
and custom user interface software.

PTC is not a primitive rendering library such as OpenGL, instead PTC is
designed as a portable graphics console for people who want to render their
own graphics and display it on the screen.


2. Open source software

PTC is now being developed as open source software. This means that the source
code is freely available and that users are encouraged to modify adapt and
contribute improvements of PTC back to the community. For more information on 
the open source concept see www.opensource.org.

PTC was ported to linux svgalib by Kevin Moule shortly after i initially 
released the source to PTC 0.71. I cannot stress how much Kevin's efforts have
encouraged me to open the source completely. After two years of closed 
development i had become very territorial about my source code but now i see 
that open source is the only way that PTC can be truly useful.

I actively encourage YOU as a user of PTC to take a look through the source 
code, play around with it, improve it, bugfix it and join with me in the 
development of PTC. Together we can make PTC the tool of choice for
software rendering on EVERY platform.
