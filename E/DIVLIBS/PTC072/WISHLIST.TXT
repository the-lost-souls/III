PTC wishlist


Banked mode support for VESA and SVGALIB. email ptc@gaffer.org if you are
interested in working on this and i will assist you.

Stabilized DirectX support. Problems have been reported on some win32 systems 
that need to be fixed. If you experience problems with PTC DirectX please 
email ptc@gaffer.org with a description of the problem. Even better, try 
looking over the DirectX code and send the bugfixes to ptc@gaffer.org :)

Support for additional platforms such as X11, GGI, BeOS etc. If you are an
experienced graphics programmer and would like to contribute by adding
support for a platform please email ptc@gaffer.org and i will provide you with
all the information and assistance you need.

More example and demo programs. If you write something cool and simple using 
PTC like a nice demo effect, please contribute it so others can learn from 
your code

Optimal pentium pixel format conversion routines: if you think you are pretty 
hot at x86 assembly, take a look at /source/x86_*.asm. If you can speed up any 
of these routines i'll give you a donut :)

New pixel format conversion routines optimized for ppro/p2, MMX. This is quite
a task... quite a bit of assembly language is required :)

Support for new image loaders. Image loading support is quite basic in PTC at 
the moment, only simple TGA loading is supported. Anyone want to add support 
for other image formats? (png, gif, jpg, pcx, bmp to name a few...). Note: all 
image loaders must load through the "File" class instead of the standard file 
i/o routines. This is so image files can be read transparently from pack files, 
directories and resources transparently. Unfortunately this makes it hard to
use 3rd party image loading libraries...

A mailing list for PTC developers to communicate. Can anyone help out with
this? :)
