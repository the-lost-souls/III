mojo by statix
--------------

This example draws a raytraced/fog/lights/weird/logo thing :)

It is portable across DOS and Win32 platforms, and is setup to generate a 
native windowed application (WinMain) under Win32.

to compile the example use the batch files provided:

    eg. "wc11 mojo"    (compile with watcom c++ 11.0)
        "vc5x mojo"    (compile with visual c++ 5.x)

NOTE: due to some very strange statix code, this demo will *not* build 
under Watcom C++ 10.x, i dont know what he's doing, but its killing the 
compiler... :)
