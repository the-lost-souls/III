In:
        edx = offset filename
        ecx = filesize (if 0, then read entire file)
        esi = fileoffset to start reading GIF

Out:
        edi = Offset decoded picture
        GIF_SWidth    DD 0                              ;Screen horisontal res
        GIF_SHeigth   DD 0                              ;Screen vertical res
        GIF_Width     DD 0                              ;Image width
        GIF_Heigth    DD 0                              ;Image heigth
        GIF_XPos      DD 0                              ;Image's horisontal pos
        GIF_YPos      DD 0                              ;Image's vertical pos
        GIF_Colors    DD 0                              ;Number of colors in GIF
        GIF_Palette   DB 768 DUP (0)                    ;Palette (RGB)

!!!Uses MEM-services!!!


     First, the decoder reserves memory for file and loads it into that
buffer (GIF_FileBuf). Then it reserves memory for codestream (GIF_CodeBuf)
and charstreams (GIF_STables). The size of GIF_CodeBuf may be too small,
(currently at 128k), which also goes for GIF_STables (currently 384k). After
reading the GIF header, it allocates memory for the picture. All other
memory allocations are deallocated before returning.

     The first 16k of the string-table is pointers to the charstreams.

STable [ 0000 ] = Offset to charstream of code 0
STable [ 0001 ] = Offset to charstream of code 1

...

STable [ MaxCode ] = Offset to charstram of code MaxCode

The first DWORD bytes of each charstream is the length of the string, followed
by the string itself.


------------------------------- IMPORTANT -----------------------------------
* The decoder won't work if GIF contains extension blocks (GIF89a)
* It DOES work with interlaced pictures
* NOT working with anything else than 256 color GIFs.
* No testing of codevalues. A corrupt GIF will phuck up everything.
