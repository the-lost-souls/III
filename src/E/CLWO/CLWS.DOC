[ CLWS (general) ]



[ Chunks ]

The chunk-headers consist of one identifier (4 bytes), followed by the
chunk's size (4 bytes), not including the header's 8 bytes. When one
chunk is read, the pointer should be moved by the chunk's size.



[ SCN_FILE_Header ]

The header of all .scn-files follows the SCN_FILE_Header (located in
w:\vectors\scn.h). The chunksize in the structure does not include the
text IDString which is 256 bytes. The chunkreading should start at
fileoffset 256.



[ SCN_FILE_Object ]



[ SCN_FILE_Light ]



[ Light-plugins ]

Following a light, there may be envelopes. There is currently four of
them, all of them following the SCN_FILE_Envelope-structures. These
envelopes are modifiers for the following light-variables, and are
one-channel keyframes (SCN_FILE_Keyframe1). The chunk ID's are as
following:

SCN_FILE_LightIntensity_ID = LINT : Modifies light's intensity.
SCN_FILE_LightRange_ID	   = LRNG : Modifies light's range.
SCN_FILE_LightEdgeAngle_ID = LEDG : Modifies light's edgeangle (spots)
SCN_FILE_LightConeAngle_ID = LCON : Modifies light's coneangle (spots)
