simple, ey?


The different types of vectors may be set up as follows. The higher ones
override the types under. That means if you first set up an object with
a standard tmap, and then sets the transparent factor to 50%, the object
will be transparent, not texturemapped.

MARK: Textures may be 15/16/24 bits. Not 32.




[ GLASS BUMPMAP (type 12) ]

Set the transparent-factor to something non-zero and add a bumpmap.

MARK: Transparent/glass-objects should not intersect each other. This
will give strange results. There may be several glass-objects in a
scene, but if they intersect each other 2D (on the screen, i.e. behind
each other in 3D), the result will be...hmm...not what you're
expecting.




[ TRANSPARENCY + ENVIRONMENTMAP ]

Set the transparent-factor to something non-zero. Add an environmentmap.

MARK: Two transparent objects intersecting each other, will not be
intersected right. Tag the "Additive" box to get additive transparency.




[ ENVIRONMENT MAPPED (type 13) ]

Set the reflectivity-factor to something non-zero. Then
select "Reflection Options". Choose "Spherical blabalal" and set a
reflection image.

MARK: Transparency must be 0.


[ TRANSPARENT COLORMAP ]

Set the transparencty-factor to something non-zero. Add a standard
colormap. Tag the "Additive" box to get additive transparency.



[ COLORMAP ]

Add a standard colormap.


[ TRANSPARENT ]

Set the transparency-factor to something non-zero.



[ GLASS (type 21) ]

If the transparency factor is non-zero, and there is a Transparent
Texture, the object will be glass-bumped. The transparency-factor still
works.




[ FLATFILLED (type 5) ]

Just do none of the above. You may set the colour.


MARK:



[ LENSFLARES, LIGHTS ]

Tag the LensFlare box. Set up the light's name as follows:

FLR1 00.0500 c;|flares|theflare.tga

* There MUST be a space between "FLR1" and the size-value.
* The sizevalue MUST follow the structure above. To digits before "."
  and four after.
* Another space between the size and the filename.
* All :'s must be written as ;'s.
* All \'s must be written as |'s.

* Fade behind objects works
* Fade off screen works
* !!!Anamorphic distort!!! Pressing this button enables fading with
  light (spot/distant). Has nothing to do with "anamorphic distortion".
  :)

The light's color is used to saturate the lensflare.




[ LENSFLARES, OBJECTS ]

Create a nullobject. Set up the nullobject's name as follows:

FLR1 00.0500 00000000 c;|flares|theflare.tga

* There MUST be a space between "FLR1" and the size-value.
* The sizevalue MUST follow the structure above. To digits before "."
  and four after.
* 8 digits represent different flags (flag 0 = rightmost, flag 7 =
  leftmost).
  	0: Set to 1, if fade behind object.
	1: Set to 1, if fade off screen
	2: Set to 1, if fade with light (spot/distant light)

* Another space between the flags and the filename.
* All :'s must be written as ;'s.
* All \'s must be written as |'s.
